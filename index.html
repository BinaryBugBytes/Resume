        <h2>Professional Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I am a firm believer that if you feel that there should be an easier way to do something, there probably is. Whether or not that way exists yet, however, is a completely different question. If not, what can we do to change that?</p>
            <p>I seek out knowledge of any and all domains. I know that I don't know everything, but knowing that there is something specific that I don't know about will keep me up at night. I enjoy researching the unknown topic and look forward to having at the very least a basic understanding and comprehension. More importantly, I want to share that new found knowledge with everyone.</p>
            <p>Data is everywhere, how to pair it and interpret it is when it becomes information. Finding the data requires creative thinking and relentless questioning. I find it thrilling to not only to put the puzzle together but in finding the pieces to begin with. To quote a teacher of mine, "Information is losing value, the ability to think is the stock to buy. The skill you need to hone is in asking good questions and understanding the answer."</p>
            <p>I am continuously looking to my expand breadth of knowledge and expertise pertaining to configuration and use of data, dedicated to finding the right solution when new challenges arise, to connect with peers and collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to produce quality results.</p>
